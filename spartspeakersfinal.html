<br>
<p> Smart homes are defined by appliances which are connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), therefore, can be remotely controlled through a mobile or any other network device, responding to the need of the user. As this market continues to rapidly increase, one of the devices that managed to catch the attention is the smart speaker. This technology provides a wireless, voice activated product, with an integrated virtual assistant software, in order to accumulate information and perform different tasks. The virtual assistant software is based on interaction and it learns as it goes, therefore, with each new command the quality of experience improves. Smart Speakers acquired instant popularity among consumers since their debut in 2015, with a market value growth of 11.7 billion by 2019. (see Chart 1) The market value is expected to triple by 2025, reaching 35.5 billion dollars, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 19.81%. </p>

      <p> The first smart speaker, hitting the market in November 2014, was Amazon Echo with Alexa intelligent personal assistant. Users were immediately fascinated about how by effortlessly saying “Hey, Alexa!” they would get support for browsing the internet, sending messages, control other smart devices and more, by simply receiving voiced results.</p>
      <br>
      <q style="color:Black;"> No customer was asking for Echo. This was definitely us wandering.</q>

  </div>

<p>Hence the popularity of this new technology, it is no wonder that many other vendors quickly appeared on the market, like Google Home smart speaker which was released in November 2016. Throughout the years, many other competitors appeared on the market such as: Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu, Apple and more. (see Chart 2) However, Amazon managed to maintain as a leader in the industry each year from late 2016 to early 2019, still holding the highest share of 21.9%. There is no debate that Amazon’s closest competitor is Google, with a share of 18.5 % of the second quarter of 2019, with a rapidly increasing development on this competitive market.</p>

<h2 style="color:Black;" class="w3-center"><b> Amazon Echo VS Google Home</b> </h2>
<br>
<p>In order to better understand why these two smart speakers hold the leading position on the market, we have to look into the consumer behaviour towards the products. Based on the share of smart speaker users in the UK, it is clear that the majority of the users owns one of these two devices, with a share of 94.2% in 2018 and, respectively, 93.3% in 2019. (see Chart 3) It is also visible that Amazon dropped from 2018 to 2019 by 4,2%, opposed to Google, who gained ground by 3,3%. However Amazon keeps a front position with almost double more users than Google.</p>

<br>
<h2 style="color:Black;" class="w3-center"><b> Why is Amazon keeping a leading position?</b> </h2>
<br>
<p>There is a lot of debate that has been done among the advantages and disadvantages of Amazon Echo and Google Home, regarding sound quality, deign, set up process and more. Bottomline, they both have unique highly-developed features, that might lead to a good user experience but why people still own twice as many devices from Amazon, rather than Google? People who own a smart speaker are probably likely to own more than one smart home device, hence, compatibility between them is a key feature. Both smart speakers have increased significantly the number of compatible products from 2018 to 2019, Amazon doubling the number and Google tripling it. (see Chart 4) However, Amazon still has twice as many devices, 60.000, compared to Google, 30.000. This could be an explanation of the user’s ownership preference towards Amazon Echo.</p>
<br>
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/893826"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
<br>
<p>In conclusion, as the industry of smart speakers continues to rapidly grow, we can expect further features or products that will innovate the market. Also Google Home is coming fast towards the first rank, therefore, a turnover may be possible.</p>
